                <h3>Competitive Comparison Chart</h3>
                <p>
                    To gain deeper insights into our users and refine our
                    approach, I conducted a thorough analysis of three products
                    with similar goals to a music platform.
                </p>

                <div class="image">

                <h3>The Competitors</h3>
                <p>
                    Through these three music platforms, I discovered that they
                    had very similar formats in how they display songs (Album
                    Cover, Song Title, Artists, Duration of Song, Icon for More
                    Options). On the other hand, where they differ is in their
                    sorting and filtering options.
                </p>

                <h4>Competitor #1: Spotify</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Most Successful: Sorting</li>
                    <h5>
                        Spotify has the most sorting options, and even a way to
                        keep the original custom order the user placed songs.
                    </h5>

                    <li>Least Successful: Filtering</li>
                    <h5>
                        Spotify lacks a lot of filtering aspects within
                        playlists. They tend to just create new playlists based
                        on filters (liked songs, artists, genre, etc.), rather
                        than modify the current state of the playlist.
                    </h5>
                </ul>

                <h4>Competitor #2: Apple Music</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Most Successful: Filtering</li>
                    <h5>
                        Apple Music has a handful of filtering options that
                        automatically modify the state of the current playlist.
                    </h5>

                    <li>Least Successful: Sorting</li>
                    <h5>
                        Apple Music only offers one sorting option, and it's
                        only by song title.
                    </h5>
                </ul>

                <h4>Competitor #3: YouTube Music</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Most Successful: Favorite Songs</li>
                    <h5>
                        YouTube Music has a strong system in favoriting songs,
                        as it's similar to the use process on the YouTube
                        platform.
                    </h5>

                    <li>Least Successful: Sorting and Filtering</li>
                    <h5>
                        YouTube Music doesn't seem to offer any filtering or
                        sorting of the playlists, not even searching by song
                        title.
                    </h5>
                </ul>

                <h3>Main Takeaway</h3>
                <p>
                    Based on these observation, my own music interface will
                    feature both a favorite aggregator and also multiple
                    filtering and sorting options.

                <h3>Brainstorming Features</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Favorite Song Aggregator</li>
                    <h5>
                        This feature worked well across all competitors. We plan
                        to implement this where the user can see the playlist in
                        live action when liking songs. We can store these in a
                        data structure, such as a hashmap or a list.
                    </h5>

                    <li>Filtering by Artist Name and Album Title</li>
                    <h5>
                        These features have also been successful and common in
                        most of the competitors. Filtering by these
                        characteristics adds more visibility on what artists and
                        albums the user likes more. We can utilize tags from
                        hashmaps to organize the data.
                    </h5>

                    <li>Sorting by Song Title</li>
                    <h5>
                        This feature has also been successful in other
                        competitors and is even the default in most music
                        libraries. We can also retrieve data from a hashmap or
                        an array and sort accordingly alphabetically.

                <h3>Intentions</h3>
                <p>
                    Our app's goal is to provide users a visual way to see how
                    long a playlist last for certain events. For instance, if a
                    users want to create a playlist that has enough songs
                    (without any repeated songs) for 1 hour road trip, then our
                    app can help. Also, if a user wants to create a playlist for
                    exactly 15 minutes, they can see what songs to add/remove to
                    reach that goal.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We use aggregation in our app by storing the added songs
                    from an "Add to Timed Playlist" button. Our app is able to
                    filter by 1) Artist Name and 2) Album Title, and also sort
                    by Song Title.
